## Starting small

Note:
- We are talking about a lot of different concepts that evolved and were put to practice over time - rather than applying everything at once -- pick one thing and go with it / try it at your organization



### Small intitiative

Note:
-


### Organizational buy-in

Note:
- bringing change to a small group is easier than taking on large groups
- proposing an org-wide chatroom was easier once small group (7 people) had experience with it and we had evidence that it worked
- initial team become early adopters of techniques and share them with other groups
- organizational/institutional buy-in is important for growth
- to sustain growth, certain operational costs (time/money/policy) will have to be absorbed at a higher level
- example: Drupal Core Mentoring and DA
  - individual drives implementing ideas
  - DA takes over after pattern established and proven
  - frees up individuals to continue to evolve and improve process

## Asking questions

Note:
- exposing ignorance is difficult
- instincts tell us to feign expert knowledge, or at best stay silent
- asking questions is the best way to expose and address gaps in knowledge



### Increase engagement

Note:
- decreases fear, asking questions can be addictive
- learned more, and became more engaged
- shows other people that it's OK to ask, learn and grow



### Safe environment

Note:
- Environment must allow exposing lack of knowledge about something in a safe, productive way
- response cannot be surprise "what? you don't know x / how to use x?"



### Techniques

Note:
- have people say "thanks for asking that." "I've been wondering that also." as a way of supporting a cultural change where asking is ok and encouraged.
- have experienced people view the asking of a question as a signal that something needs changing: a doc needs to be more easily found, needs extra information

## Working together

Note:
- An issue is not solved by just one person from beginning to end (it cannot be, you can't review your own patches changes, in other words, you can't accept your own merge/pull request)
- There are multiple people come and do parts of the overall work



## Do not work primarily alone

Note:
- frequent check-in with others (ties back to Breaking down problems): people break off to do solo work, but check with one another throughout the day
- pairing - two people working together, switching control at intervals so that each person spends time typing



## Always be mentoring

Note:
