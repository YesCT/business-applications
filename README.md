## Starting small

Note:
- We are talking about a lot of different concepts that evolved and were put to practice over time - rather than applying everything at once -- pick one thing and go with it / try it at your organization



### Small intitiative



### Organizational buy-in

Note:
- bringing change to a small group is easier than taking on large groups
- proposing an org-wide chatroom was easier once small group (7 people) had experience with it and we had evidence that it worked
- initial team become early adopters of techniques and share them with other groups
- organizational/institutional buy-in is important for growth
- to sustain growth, certain operational costs (time/money/policy) will have to be absorbed at a higher level
- example: Drupal Core Mentoring and DA
  - individual drives implementing ideas
  - DA takes over after pattern established and proven
  - frees up individuals to continue to evolve and improve process

## Asking questions

Note:
- exposing ignorance is difficult
- instincts tell us to feign expert knowledge, or at best stay silent
- asking questions is the best way to expose and address gaps in knowledge



### Increase engagement

Note:
- decreases fear, asking questions can be addictive
- learned more, and became more engaged
- shows other people that it's OK to ask, learn and grow



### Safe environment

Note:
- Environment must allow exposing lack of knowledge about something in a safe, productive way
- response cannot be surprise "what? you don't know x / how to use x?"



### Techniques

Note:
- have people say "thanks for asking that." "I've been wondering that also." as a way of supporting a cultural change where asking is ok and encouraged.
- have experienced people view the asking of a question as a signal that something needs changing: a doc needs to be more easily found, needs extra information
