## Asking questions

Note:
- exposing ignorance is difficult
- instincts tell us to feign expert knowledge, or at best stay silent
- asking questions is the best way to expose and address gaps in knowledge



### increase engagement

Note:
- decreases fear, asking questions can be addictive
- learned more, and became more engaged
- shows other people that it's OK to ask, learn and grow


### safe environment

Note:
- Environment must allow exposing lack of knowledge about something in a safe, productive way
- response cannot be surprise "what? you don't know x / how to use x?"



## techniques
- have people say "thanks for asking that." "I've been wondering that also." as a way of supporting a cultural change where asking is ok and encouraged.
- have experienced people view the asking of a question as a signal that something needs changing: a doc needs to be more easily found, needs extra information
